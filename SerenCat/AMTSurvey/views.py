Shiv\'s story shifts back and forth in time so that readers are gradually informed about the tensions that emerged on that fateful vacation, the competition Shiv and Declan felt for the attentions of glamorous Nikos, their guide on a scuba diving expedition, and the lies Shiv told to maintain her relationship with Nikos while excluding Declan. No wonder she feels guilty. But she\'s not alone. Each of the young adults at the Korsakoff Clinic has suffered the traumatic loss of a loved one and each of them feels responsibility for the death. At first, the course of therapy seems relatively benign: walking, talking, and writing. The subsequent stages are much more brutal and are intended to break the patients psychologically in order to patch them together again. This is a dangerous process, and not all of the teens will be able to recover their equilibrium.

Beginning in 1699 with the publication of Edward Tyson’s famous comparison of a human and a chimp, Marks structures his historical account around the assumptions that have given rise to the 20th-century biological concept of race….

She was first contacted by Aliens while a baby and was abducted for the first time at age four. These particular events were not in her consciousness until much later in her life. The trigger that brought these occurrences back into her consciousness was an Alien abduction experience while on a road trip in 1988. Her journey leads her to The Four Corners Area of the southwestern United States. Since that time there have been many other encounters with \'Tall Blond\' Aliens. The relationship that developed between Miriam and the Aliens became one of Teacher-Student and finally culminated into that of Emissary. As a direct request from the \'Tall Blonds\', and to fulfill the role of Emissary, she has written \'Blue Star - Fulfilling Prophecy\'.

Pavord, in prose as rich and colorful as the too-infrequent illustrations, contextualizes plant classification within larger intellectual, political and cultural spheres, but she verges dangerously close to writing a textbook; the vast amount of information she packs into brief, rapid-fire sections can overwhelm. In the best sections, she slows down to draw detailed portraits of researchers and describe how each contributed to the slowly evolving (and, until the late 1600\\\'s, unnamed) science of botany. Ray, for instance, marked "a quiet, lonely, dogged consummation" with "no fireworks, no claps of thunder, no swelling symphonic themes" when, shortly before his death and suffering from gangrene, he penned the six fundamental rules of botany. Pavord\\\'s prose dazzles, but it\\\'s not enough to carry readers with a casual interest in plants or gardening through an otherwise dense history.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Words fall on the pages as images might come and go from a teen\\\'s mind and mouth. From the very brief (one poem is only four words long) to the full-page barrage of emotions, the poet is quite adept at listening to the voices in readers\\\' heads. "Will I ever learn to love me first?" and "Will the sun for real rise up tomorrow?" are just two of the alternately philosophical and realistic concerns just bursting to be released from the jumble of the teenage mind. Adoff uncovers the masks teens wear, poses the question of love versus lust, offers a look at the dangers of drug use, and presents telling glimpses of body image. There is a beat to many of the selections, keeping readers moving forward. The poems\\\' free-form shapes enforce the transitory and flashing images. In one sense, the structure aids the readability, making the verses appear as quick reads. But there is a great deal of depth here, with some of the selections providing more of an intellectual challenge.

Unfortunately, this latest work from author and Catholic convert Hahn consists mostly of a didactic treatment of the theology of Opus Dei, containing little that is compelling about its relationship to Hahn\\\'s life. The author was drawn to Opus Dei after meeting several of its members at a time when he was pondering whether to join the Catholic Church. Disappointed in the lack of zeal he had found among other Catholics, he was pleased to discover in Opus Dei members a lively faith that was closer to what he had known among fellow evangelical Protestants. "Opus Dei," he writes, "was someplace where I could begin to feel at home." Other than this brief personal vignette, Hahn remains in the role of teacher and biblical theologian, expounding on the group\\\'s tenets as formed by its founder, St. Josemaría Escrivá. Hahn\\\'s book is useful as an introduction to Opus Dei for those seeking to learn about the organization and its spiritual foundations, but it could have benefited from greater personal reflection.(Oct. 3)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Insisting that "if a lesson is worth teaching once, it is worth teaching at least two thousand times," the trio use a conversational, collaborative approach to make each themed chapter (including dating, health and beauty, education, career, and, of course, parenting) stick, trading off charismatic group narration with first-person interjections and personal stories that expand upon traditional, time-tested advice: "We come from a long line of long marriages. ...We were taught it is normal to go through bad times in a marriage, even bad year."
